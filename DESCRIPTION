Title: Estimate energy fluxes in food webs
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Benoit Gauzens 
Maintainer: Benoit Gauzens <benoit.gauzens@gmail.com>
Description: fluxweb is a package to compute energy fluxes from resources to their consumers and can be applied to systems ranging from simple two-species interactions to highly complex food webs. It implements the approach described in Gauzens et al. (Hopefully published ahead of time) to calculate energy fluxes, which are also used to calculate equilibrium stability.
